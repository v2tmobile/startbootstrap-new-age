            <p>XPartner App does not share your personal information except as approved by you or as described below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We may release your information as permitted by law or when we believe that release is appropriate to comply
                    with the law; enforce or apply our rights; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our users,
                    or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</li>
                <li>If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your information shared with a third party for marketing purposes,
                    we will share your information with the third party (or third parties) in which case the third party’s
                    use of your information is subject to the third party’s own privacy policy.</li>
                <li>We may share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment
                    processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services,
                    and customer service.</li>

                    divestiture or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may
                    share, disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor
                    organization in such transition.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</h2>
            <p>XPartner App takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized
                alteration, disclosure or destruction of, sensitive data that you share and we collect and store. These security
                measures may include practices such as keeping your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall,
                transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on our site or mobile application
                using secure socket layer technology (SSL), internal reviews of our data collection practices and platforms,
                as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store your
                information. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Service in a secure
                operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that
                information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the
                integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
                third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this information. We do not warrant or represent
                that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.</p>
            <h2>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
            <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data and certain anonymous data.</p>

                <li>When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop
                    receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following
                    the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive.</li>
                <li>Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communication, including notices

                    be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time,
                    in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
                    When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
